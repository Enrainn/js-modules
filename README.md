# js-modules
Simple demos for JavaScript modules:
- IIFE - standard, auto-embed, Ajax
- CommonJS for frontend with Browserify
- AMD with RequireJS
- UMD AMD, CommonJS, IIFE
- ES6 with Rollup.js and Webpack 2, using `import` and `System.import()`

These demos have been developed for a tutorial in [c't Magazin](https://ct.de/), to be published in early 2017.
